# OOP

# using OOP helps make code more manageable
# OOP is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects to encapsulate data and behavior into a single, organized unit.
# it helps code easier to maintain, extend and write. it helps to structure our code

# while defining a class must follow naming conventions.
# following camel case naming convention is best practice, in camel case every first letter of a new word is capitalized

class BigObject:
    pass

# class is the blueprint
# instantiate is the action of creating different instances of a class.
# Instances are all objects
# using class with parentheses will create an instance of that class, and it's called instantiation
# eg: obj1 = BigObject() here we instantiated an object of class BigObject
# blueprint class is going to be stored in memory
