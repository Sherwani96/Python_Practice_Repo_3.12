# Naming Conventions
# Any suitable identifier can be used as a name of a variable, based on the following rules:

# The name of the variable should start with either an alphabet letter (lower or upper case) or an underscore (_), but it cannot start with a digit.
# More than one alpha-numeric characters or underscores may follow.
# The variable name can consist of alphabet letter(s), number(s) and underscore(s) only. For example, myVar, MyVar, _myVar, MyVar123 are valid variable names, but m*var, my-var, 1myVar are invalid variable names.
# Variable names in Python are case sensitive. So, NAME, name, nAME, and nAmE are treated as different variable names.
# Variable names cannot be a reserved keywords in Python.
