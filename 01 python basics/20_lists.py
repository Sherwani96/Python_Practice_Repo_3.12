# list is an ordered sequence of objects that can be of any type
# list is mutable

li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
li2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
li3 = [1, 2.5, 'a', True]

# all of the above are lists
# in lists we can store any type of data
# in other programming languages like javascript it is called an Array, while in python it is called List.

# Data Structure
# for organizing data or information
# each item in a particular index is stored in different memory location
# list items can only be accessed through the particular index call
