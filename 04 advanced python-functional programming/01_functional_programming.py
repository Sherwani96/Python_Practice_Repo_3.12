# functional programming is all about separation of concerns which oop does as well.
# it is about breaking down the problem into smaller parts and solving them one by one
# instead of combining methods and attributes, we separate them
#  functional language have emphasis on on simplicity where data and functions are concerned
# but the goal here is functional programming paradigm is same as an object oriented programming
# goal
# 01. it's the idea of making our code clean and understandable
# 02. easy to extend, (that is we can grow our code make it better and better and have others to extend our code)
# 03. easy to maintain
# memory efficient
# DRY, it keeps our code dry
