# we can have another package inside a package
# simply can be imported with the following format
# import packageFolderName.subFolderName.modulename
# instead of doing or following the above format we can alternately use the following format to make our code neat and clean
# from packageFolderName.subFolderName.modulename import functionName
# also we can import entire module like
# from packageFolderName.subFolderName import moduleName
# the best to import is just import that specific chunk of code not the entire module, because it may have conflicts
