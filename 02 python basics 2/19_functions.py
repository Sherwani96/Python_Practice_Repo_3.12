# functions exists in every programming language
# when you type def interpreter knows that you are going to type function

# def say_hello()
# say_hello is the function name and parentheses after name means it tells interpreter that this is function is going to take action on the data type.

def say_hello():
    print('Hello!!!')

#  in order to call function we need to call it brackets or parentheses
# in order to prevent from DRY principle we usually use functions for repetitions
# function cannot be call before defining the function, it will always be called after defining it
