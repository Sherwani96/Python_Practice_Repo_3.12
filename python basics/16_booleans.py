# booleans can either be True or False

# eg consider facebook login feature

name = 'Ahmed'
is_login = False # here it tells that currently i'm not login

# but now
is_login = True # now i'm login so it becomes true here

# here in bool 
print(bool(0)) # here 0 in boolean means false
print(bool(1)) # here 1 in boolean means true


print(bool('hi')) # here we converted 'hi' to true in boolean means 1
